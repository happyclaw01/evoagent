INFORMATION TO EXTRACT:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the information relevant to the focus above.
2. If the exact information is not found, extract the most closely related details.
3. Be specific and include exact details when available.
4. Clearly organize the extracted information for easy understanding.
5. Do not include general summaries or unrelated content.
6. CRITICAL: If the content is from a prediction market (e.g. Manifold Markets, Polymarket, Metaculus, etc.), you MUST NOT extract or reveal any resolution/settlement results such as "Resolved YES", "Resolved NO", "Resolved N/A", final outcomes, or settlement statuses. Only extract pre-resolution information such as current probabilities, market descriptions, comments, analysis, and discussion. Omit any sentence that reveals how a market resolved.
7. TIME CONSTRAINT: If the INFORMATION TO EXTRACT mentions a time constraint or deadline (e.g. "before 2026-01-18"), you MUST only extract information that was published or available BEFORE that date. Do NOT extract any facts, news, results, or outcomes that were published on or after the deadline. If the content is a news article or report published after the deadline, return only background information that would have been known before the deadline and explicitly note that the article was published after the cutoff date.
